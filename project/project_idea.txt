I have an idea to build a database of professors in the U.S. who are recruiting Phd students to do reseach in Human Computer Interaction field. The HCI field is very broad and diverse, so many students (including myself) have trouble finding an advisor and program to get their phd. 

The entity sets will look like the entity sets that are commonly used to build databases for schools. They should capture professors' basic information, including school name, depart name, contact information, and their research focus. Additionally, the information about the labs that they are working/leading in should also be captured in an entity set. The database also includes general information about the school and department, such as location, number of students, and so on. The key information I want to include or distract from the database is if the professors are hiring new phd students. Thus, I'm thinking to add funding information associated with professors and information about members in their labs. For instance, I could include professors' current phd students and their information in the database. I'm assuming that if there are graduating phd students, there might be some chance that the professor is going to hire new students. And, the newly graduated phd students may be hired in some university to start their research and may be looking for new students. The relationships could expand to cover most part of academia. This is like a family tree that capture relationships among scholars.
