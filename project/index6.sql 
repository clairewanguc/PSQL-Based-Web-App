-- here is results after indexing 
--explain select profname from professors natural join students where students.gradname = profname;

--Seq Scan on students  (cost=0.00..180.26 rows=11026 width=5)



--results after running the following code 
-- explain select adname from students where adname = 'name';
-- Seq Scan on students  (cost=0.00..207.83 rows=1 width=4)
create index idx_adname on students(adname);
-- results after indexing 
-- Index Only Scan using idx_adname on students  (cost=0.29..8.30 rows=1 width=4)
-- so the index helped to look up a specific thing from the tabel with many records
